# TARDIS-MCP

A TARDIS based resource pack for the [TARDIS](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tardis/) Bukkit plugin. This pack takes advantage of the Connected textures Mod and Custom Item Textures available when using [MCPatcher](https://bitbucket.org/prupe/mcpatcher/wiki/Home)/[OptiFine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272953) (one or the other required!).

## Installation
