##Installation

2. Start GitHub client and create a free GitHub account (if you don’t have one)
3. In your web browser, navigate to the TARDIS resource pack repositories

4. Click the Clone in Desktop button
5. Save the repository clone in the minecraft/resourcepacks folder
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each resource pack
7. To update the resource pack, use the desktop client to ‘Pull’ in any changes.
